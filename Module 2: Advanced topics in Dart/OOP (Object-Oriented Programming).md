# 🧩 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Dart

Learn the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Dart — including **classes**, **objects**, **class members**, and **constructors**.  
In Dart, everything revolves around **objects**.

---

## 🧩 What is OOP?

**Object-oriented programming (OOP)** is a programming method that uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications. It is one of the most popular programming paradigms and is used in many programming languages, such as Dart, Java, C++, Python, etc.

In **OOP**, an object can be anything, such as a person, a bank account, a car, or a house. Each object has its attributes (or properties) and behavior (or methods). For example, a person object may have the attributes name, age and height, and the behavior walk and talk. 

In Dart, OOP helps you organize your program into smaller, reusable, and more manageable parts.

---
### Benefits
* It is simple to use and comprehend.
*  It reduces complexity and boosts reusability.
*  Programmers are becoming more productive.
*  It facilitates the maintenance, modification, and debugging of the code.
*  It encourages cooperation and teamwork.
*  It lessens the amount of code repetition.

### Features Of OOP
1. Class
2. Object
3. Encapsulation
4. Inheritance
5. Polymorphism
6. Abstraction

## 🏗️ What is a Class?

A **class** is a **blueprint** or **template** used to create objects.  
It defines the structure — what properties (data) and methods (functions) an object will have.

### Example:
```dart
class Car {
  String brand = "Toyota";
  int year = 2022;

  void showInfo() {
    print("Brand: $brand, Year: $year");
  }
}
```

---

## 🚗 What is an Object?

An object is an instance of a class — a real example created from the blueprint.
It allows you to use the data and behavior defined inside the class.

### Example:
```dart
void main() {
  Car myCar = Car(); // Create an object of class Car
  myCar.showInfo();  // Access the method using the object
}
```

Output:
```dart
Brand: Toyota, Year: 2022
```
---

## 📘 Class Members

A class can contain two main types of members:

* Fields (variables) — store data
* Methods (functions) — define behavior

These members represent the state and behavior of an object.

### Example:
```dart
class Student {
  String name = "Tanjim";
  int age = 20;

  void display() {
    print("Name: $name, Age: $age");
  }
}
```
```dart
void main() {
  Student s1 = Student(); // Create an object of class Student
  s1.display();           // Call the method using the object
}
```
Output:
```dart
Name: Tanjim, Age: 20
```

---

## 🧮 Constructor (Special Method)

A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects automatically when they are created.
It helps assign values to variables when you create a new object.

### Example:
```dart
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;

  // Constructor
  Person(this.name, this.age);

  void showDetails() {
    print("Name: $name, Age: $age");
  }
}

void main() {
  Person p1 = Person("Samir", 21); // Create object with constructor
  p1.showDetails();
}
```
Output:
```dart
Name: Samir, Age: 21
```
---
## 📘 Static 
In Dart, you can access static properties (or variables) directly from the class name, without creating an object (instance) of the class.

### 🧩 Example: Accessing Static Properties
```dart
class Student {
  static String schoolName = "ABC High School";
  String name;

  Student(this.name);

  void display() {
    print("Student Name: $name");
    print("School: $schoolName");
  }
}

void main() {
  // Access static property directly from the class
  print(Student.schoolName); // ✅ Output: ABC High School

  // Change static property value
  Student.schoolName = "XYZ International School";

  // Access again to see the change
  print(Student.schoolName); // ✅ Output: XYZ International School

  // You can still use it in instance methods
  Student s1 = Student("Tanjim");
  s1.display();
}
```
----
## 📘 Method 
A method is just a function inside a class that does some action.

```dart
class Calculator {
  int num1 = 0;
  int num2 = 0;

  void add() {
    int sum = num1 + num2;
    print("Sum of the numbers: $sum");
  }

  void multiply() {
    int mul = num1 * num2;
    print("Multiplication of the numbers: $mul");
  }
}

void main() {
  Calculator calc = Calculator(); // create object
  calc.num1 = 5;
  calc.num2 = 10;

  calc.add();
  calc.multiply();
}
```
```sql
Sum of the numbers: 15
Multiplication of the numbers: 50
```
### 🧠 Explanation:

add() and multiply() are methods inside the class.
You create one object: Calculator calc = Calculator();

You set values for the object’s variables:
calc.num1 = 5;
calc.num2 = 10;

Then you call the methods:
calc.add();
calc.multiply();

## 📘 What is a Constructor?

A constructor is a special method inside a class that runs automatically when you create an object.
It’s used to initialize (give starting values) to the object’s variables.

### 🧱 Types of Constructors

* Default constructor – automatically created if you don’t write one.
* Parameterized constructor – takes parameters.
* Named constructor – special name for different ways of creating objects.

---
### 1. Default Constructor

```dart
class Student {
  String? name;
  int? age;
}

void main() {
  Student s1 = Student(); // Default constructor
  s1.name = "Tanjim";
  s1.age = 20;
  print("${s1.name}, ${s1.age}");
}
```
---
### Parameterized constructor
```dart
class Student {
  String name;
  int age;

  // Constructor
  Student(this.name, this.age);

  void display() {
    print("Name: $name, Age: $age");
  }
}

void main() {
  Student s1 = Student("Tanjim", 20); // constructor runs automatically
  s1.display();
}
```
### Named Constructor
```dart
class Student {
  String name = "";
  int age = 0;

  // Named constructor
  Student.guest() {
    name = "Guest";
    age = 0;
  }

  void display() {
    print("Name: $name, Age: $age");
  }
}

void main() {
  Student s1 = Student.guest();
  s1.display();
}
```
---
## ⚙️ Function & Constructor Overloading in Dart

❌ Dart does not support traditional method or constructor overloading
(as in languages like Java or C++).

That means —
you cannot define multiple methods or constructors with the same name but different parameters.

For example 👇
This will cause an error in Dart:
```dart
class Student {
  Student(String name) {
    print("Name: $name");
  }

  // ❌ ERROR: Dart does not allow another constructor with same name
  Student(String name, int age) {
    print("Name: $name, Age: $age");
  }
}
```
### 🧠 Why?

Because Dart identifies functions by name only, not by parameter list.
So, having two constructors or methods with the same name creates a conflict.
