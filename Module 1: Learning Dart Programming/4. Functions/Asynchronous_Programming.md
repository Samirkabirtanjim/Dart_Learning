## 🧩 1️⃣ What is Asynchronous Programming?

* Synchronous: Tasks run one by one, blocking the next until the current finishes.
* Asynchronous: Tasks can run without waiting, letting the program continue, and handling results later when ready.

Dart uses Future, async, await, and Stream for async programming.
