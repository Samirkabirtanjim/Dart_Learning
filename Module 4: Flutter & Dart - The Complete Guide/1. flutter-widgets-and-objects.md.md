### 1. What is a Widget in Flutter?

A widget is just a description of what the UI should look like.

👉 It does NOT draw anything itself.
👉 It only tells Flutter: “Show this text”, “Put this button here”, etc.

## Example:

```sql
Text("Hello")
```

This means: “I want text that says Hello.”

### 2. What are Objects?

In Dart, everything is an object — like:

* Widgets
* Controllers
* Styles
* Colors

An object is something that stores data and helps control behavior.

### 3. What are Configuration Objects (Non-Widget Objects)?

These are objects that help widgets, but are not widgets themselves.

They control:

🎨 How things look
⚙️ How things behave

```sql
Examples:
TextStyle(fontSize: 20)          // style object
TextEditingController()         // control object
EdgeInsets.all(16)              // spacing object
```

These are not UI, but they help UI widgets work properly.
